# Face-Detection
Face Detection using keras and tensorflow.

## Overview

In this project I have developed a face detection model using libraries like 
* Keras (for building the model and calling the VGG16 Transfer Learning Model)
* Tensorflow  (for image data storing, loading etc)
* Labelme (for annotations)
* Albumentation (for data augmentation)
* numpy (for artihmetic operation on array like converting images to grayscale by dividing the whole image array by 255)
* os (for directory related processes)
* cv2 (reading and writing images)
* matplotlib (visualization)

I may have missed some libraries, but te mentioned libraries are precisely what I used for majority of the code.


Take a look at the detection by this model-

## I have removed images from output of visualization in the notebook as I didn't wanted to have it on my github.
